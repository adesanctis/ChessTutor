Starting from [October Chess](https://github.com/skeeto/october-chess-engine) for board and interactions and integrating a UCI chess Interface [UCIChess](https://github.com/tondeur-h/UCIChess), I'd like to implement a step by step tutor chess program based on Stockfish.
For each position engine analyzes shortly best moves suggesting what is more useful.
You can request a deep analysis (30 seconds as default).
You can request analysis for a possible move (on right click).

Each position analysis in reported with next moves and a score in the list belowe.
